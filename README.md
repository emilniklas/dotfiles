# Emil's Dotfiles

Configuration files and installation scripts for the tools that I use.

```sh
./make.sh [dependencies...]
```

## Example

I use a combination of [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [TMUX](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), and [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) for my usual setup. Just by running `./make.sh alacritty`, all of that will be set up.

For my [NeoVim](http://neovim.io) setup, I can just run `./make.sh neovim`.

Running `./make.sh` without arguments will install everything.
